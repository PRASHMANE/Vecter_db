ðŸ“š What is a Vector Database?   
A Vector Database is a type of database optimized for storing, indexing, and searching high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings are typically generated from data like text, images, or audio using AI models (e.g., sentence transformers, CLIP, OpenAI embeddings).

Unlike traditional databases that store structured/tabular data, vector databases are built for similarity search â€” answering questions like:

"Find me documents that are semantically similar to this query."

ðŸš€ Why Use a Vector Database?
Vector databases are essential in modern AI/ML applications, especially those involving:

ðŸ§  Semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

ðŸ¤– Chatbots that retrieve context-aware information

ðŸ“¸ Image similarity search

ðŸ§¾ Recommendation systems

ðŸ§ª How Vector Search Works
Embed your data using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence Transformers)

Store the vector embeddings in the database

Query by embedding a user query and searching for the nearest neighbors using metrics like cosine similarity or dot product
